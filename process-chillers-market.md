<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The process chillers market comprises two primary types: air-cooled and water-cooled systems. Air-cooled chillers dissipate heat into the atmosphere through fans and are typically more energy-efficient and easier to install. They are ideal for environments with limited water supply. In contrast, water-cooled chillers use water to dissipate heat and generally offer higher efficiency, making them suitable for larger facilities. Each type caters to specific industrial needs, balancing efficiency, installation requirements, and operational costs.</p></p>
