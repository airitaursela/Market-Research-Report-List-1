<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracolumbar Fixation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Instrumented Fusions</li><li>Non-Instrumented Fusions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thoracolumbar fixation market is divided into two primary types: instrumented fusions and non-instrumented fusions. Instrumented fusions involve the use of hardware like screws, rods, or plates to stabilize the spine during healing, enhancing structural support and alignment. Non-instrumented fusions rely on biological processes alone for stabilization, utilizing bone grafts without additional devices. Both methods aim to treat spinal instability, but instrumented fusions tend to offer better immediate stabilization and correction of spinal deformities compared to non-instrumented methods.</p></p>
